    "# Saving Specific Columns from a CSV File\n",

    "In this code, we will learn how to read a CSV file and save specific columns to a new CSV file using the `pandas` library in Python. The process involves several key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importing the necessary library**: We'll start by importing the `pandas` library, which is essential for data manipulation tasks in Python.\n",
    "- **Loading the CSV file into a DataFrame**: We will load the entire CSV file into a DataFrame, which is a powerful data structure provided by `pandas`.\n",
    "- **Selecting the desired columns**: After loading the data, we will focus on selecting only the columns that are relevant for our specific task.\n",
    "- **Saving those columns into a new CSV file**: Finally, we will save the selected columns into a new CSV file, ensuring that the resulting file contains only the data we need.\n"

    "# CSV Document Loading with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, we are using the `CSVLoader` from the `langchain_community.document_loaders` module to load data from a CSV file into the standard LangChain `Document` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Document Loaders\n",
    "Document loaders in LangChain are responsible for loading data into a consistent format, known as a `Document`. This format is crucial for various downstream tasks like retrieval, processing, and generation. Each document loader is designed to handle specific types of data, and despite their differences, they all utilize the `.load()` method to load data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CSVLoader\n",
    "The `CSVLoader` is a specialized document loader designed for handling CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files. A CSV file is a text file where each line represents a data record, and fields within a record are separated by commas. This format is widely used for storing tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we are loading the CSV data such that each row in the file is treated as a separate `Document`. The key steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading the CSV File**: We specify the path to the CSV file (`file_path`) and the encoding used (`encoding='utf-8'`).\n",
    "- **Invoking the .load() Method**: This method reads the CSV file and loads its contents into a list of `Document` objects. Each `Document` corresponds to a row in the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the code that achieves this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_community.document_loaders.csv_loader import CSVLoader\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the CSVLoader with the file path and encoding\n",
    "loader = CSVLoader(file_path=\"./english_mufti_taqi_usmani.csv\", encoding='utf-8')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the data from the CSV file into a list of Document objects\n",

I again passed by Moses and he said to me: \\'Return to your Lord, for yourfollowers will not be able to bear it. So I returned to Allah and He said, \\'These are five prayers andthey are all (equal to) fifty (in reward) for My Word does not change.\\' I returned to Moses and he toldme to go back once again.

Then he took my hand andascended with me to the nearest heaven, when I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to thegatekeeper of the heaven, \\'Open (the gate).\\' The gatekeeper asked, \\'Who is it?\\' Gabriel answered:\\'Gabriel.\\' He asked, \\'Is there anyone with you?\\' Gabriel replied, \\'Yes, Muhammad I is with me.\\' Heasked, \\'Has he been called?\\' Gabriel said, \\'Yes.\\' So the gate was opened and we went over the nearestheaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people on his right and some on his left. When helooked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said,\\'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.\\' I asked Gabriel, \\'Who is he?\\' He replied, \\'He is Adam andthe people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people ofParadise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he looks towards his right he laughs andwhen he looks towards his left he weeps.\\'Then he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper,\\'Open (the gate).\\' The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had saidand he opened the gate. Anas said: \"Abu Dhar added that the Prophet (ﷺ) met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesusand Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he(the Prophet (ﷺ) ) met Adam on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth heaven. Anas said, \"WhenGabriel along with the Prophet (ﷺ) passed by Idris, the latter said, \\'Welcome!

    "# Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are a fundamental concept in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. They are dense vector representations of text, where each word, sentence, or document is represented as a point in a continuous vector space. The idea behind embeddings is to capture the semantic meaning of the text in a way that similar meanings are close together in this space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Traditional text representations, like one-hot encoding, result in very high-dimensional and sparse vectors. Embeddings reduce this dimensionality while retaining the relationships between different words or phrases.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Semantic Similarity**: Embeddings capture the meaning of words or sentences. Words with similar meanings will have vectors that are close together in the embedding space. For example, the words \"king\" and \"queen\" might be represented by vectors that are very close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Model Performance**: Using embeddings can improve the performance of machine learning models because they provide a richer, more meaningful representation of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Are Embeddings Generated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are typically generated using pre-trained models that have been trained on large corpora of text. These models learn to map words or sentences to vectors in a high-dimensional space. In this example, we use the **\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"** model from the Sentence Transformers library.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"**: This is a pre-trained model that generates embeddings for sentences. It is efficient and compact, making it suitable for a variety of applications, including search and retrieval tasks. The model learns to create vectors where semantically similar sentences are close together in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Are Embeddings Used?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Similarity Search**: By comparing the embeddings of different texts, you can find similar texts or rank them based on similarity. This is useful in applications like information retrieval, document clustering, and recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Downstream Tasks**: Embeddings are often used as input features for other machine learning models. Because they encapsulate the semantic meaning of text, they can improve the performance of models on tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, embeddings are powerful tools that transform text into dense vectors that capture semantic meaning. They are essential for many modern NLP applications, enabling tasks that require understanding the relationships between words, sentences, or even entire documents. In our code, we use the **\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"** model to generate these embeddings, allowing us to perform similarity searches and other complex tasks efficiently.\n"
