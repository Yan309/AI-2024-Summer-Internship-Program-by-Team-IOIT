When both $P$ and $Q$ are unknown, we construct\nminimax rate-optimal estimators whose worst case performance is essentially\nthat of the known $Q$ case with $Q$ being uniform, implying that $Q$ being\nuniform is essentially the most difficult case. The \\emph{effective sample size\nenlargement} phenomenon, identified in Jiao \\emph{et al.} (2015), holds both in\nthe known $Q$ case for every $Q$ and the $Q$ unknown case.

A major advantage of such drone small cells is that the\noperators can quickly provide cellular services in areas of urgent demand\nwithout having to pre-install any infrastructure. Since the base station is\nattached to the drone, technically it is feasible for the base station to\ndynamic reposition itself in response to the changing locations of users for\nreducing the communication distance, decreasing the probability of signal\nblocking, and ultimately increasing the spectral efficiency.

Both\nreceivers reproduce the source component $S^n_2$ losslessly; and Receiver $1$\nalso reproduces the source component $S^n_1$ lossily, to within some prescribed\nfidelity level $D_1$.

In this contribution we\nintroduce the GAMP decoder for SS codes, we confirm empirically the\nuniversality of this communication scheme through its study on various channels\nand we provide the main analysis tools: state evolution and potential.

Initial efforts to\ncreate unified robot systems in the 1990s led to hybrid architectures,\nemphasizing a hierarchy in which deliberative plans direct the use of reactive\nskills. However, since that time there has been significant progress in the\nlow-level skills available to robots, including manipulation and perception,\nmaking it newly feasible to accomplish many more tasks in real-world domains.\nThere is thus renewed optimism that robots will be able to perform a wide array\nof tasks while maintaining responsiveness to human operators.

In the absence\nof hand-crafted reward functions, prior work on the topic has proposed several\nmethods for reward estimation by using expert state trajectories and action\npairs. However, there are cases where complete or good action information\ncannot be obtained from expert demonstrations.

The internal model is obtained in the form of a predictive model for the\ngiven expert state distribution. During reinforcement learning, the agent\npredicts the reward as a function of the difference between the actual state\nand the state predicted by the internal model.

At a high level, the idea\nbehind this inference is simple: the further apart in the Tree of Life are two\nspecies, the greater is the number of mutations to have accumulated in their\ngenomes since their most recent common ancestor. In order to obtain accurate\nestimates in phylogenetic analyses, it is standard practice to employ\nstatistical approaches based on stochastic models of sequence evolution on a\ntree. For tractability, such models necessarily make simplifying assumptions\nabout the evolutionary mechanisms involved. In particular, commonly omitted are\ninsertions and deletions of nucleotides -- also known as indels.\nProperly accounting for indels in statistical phylogenetic analyses remains a\nmajor challenge in computational evolutionary biology. Here we consider the\nproblem of reconstructing ancestral sequences on a known phylogeny in a model\nof sequence evolution incorporating nucleotide substitutions, insertions and\ndeletions, specifically the classical TKF91 process. We focus on the case of\ndense phylogenies of bounded height, which we refer to as the taxon-rich\nsetting, where statistical consistency is achievable. We give the first\npolynomial-time ancestral reconstruction algorithm with provable guarantees\nunder constant rates of mutation. Our algorithm succeeds when the phylogeny\nsatisfies the \"big bang\" condition, a necessary and sufficient condition for\nstatistical consistency in this context.\n\n            Subject: \n            .[/INST]  [\"Physics\"]  [\"Computer Science\"]  [\"Quantitative Finance\"]  [\"Quantitative</p>"},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"**** [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"<p>[INST]Being an expert who can detect subject in a given abstract\n        enclosed in “” please read the provided abstract. \n        Identify and list the subject that the provided abstract might be of or closest to, list only one\n        Consider the following subjects: \n        Computer Science\n        Physics\n        Mathematics\n        Statistics\n        Quantitative Biology\n        Quantitative Finance\n        Other\n        If no subjects are detected or the abstract is unclear, return ['Other']. \n        your answer should be in the form of a Python list containing subject label only mentioned above and presented like as an example\n        given below:\n        Subject : ['Statistics']\n            Text:   Subject of research is complex networks and network systems.
