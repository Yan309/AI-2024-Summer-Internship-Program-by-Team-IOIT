    "Created in 1980s primarily as a teaching and scripting language, Python has since become an essential tool for many programmers, engineers, researchers, and data scientists across academia and industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The appeal of Python is in its simplicity, as well as the convenience of the large ecosystem of domain-specific tools that have been built on top of it.\n",
    "For example, most of the Python code in scientific computing and data science is built around a group of mature and useful packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [NumPy](http://numpy.org) provides efficient storage and computation for multi-dimensional data arrays.\n",
    "- [SciPy](http://scipy.org) contains a wide array of numerical tools such as numerical integration and interpolation.\n",
    "- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) provides a DataFrame object along with a powerful set of methods to manipulate, filter, group, and transform data.\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) provides a useful interface for creation of publication-quality plots and figures.\n",
    "- [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org) provides a uniform toolkit for applying common machine learning algorithms to data.\n",
    "- [IPython/Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) provides an enhanced terminal and an interactive notebook environment that is useful for exploratory analysis, as well as creation of interactive, executable documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "No less important are the numerous other tools and packages which accompany these: if there is a scientific or data analysis task you want to perform, chances are someone has written a package that will do it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this tutorial is to provide a solid foundation for users to become familiar working with Python and the Pandas library. Therefore, the first part of this tutorial explains how to do programming in Python. The second half details working with the Pandas library. Both of these topics are reinforced with the use of examples.  "

    "2. Secondly, to convert this or any Jupyter Notebook to PDF (Portable Document Format), we would also need to install a [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) distribution. This step is **OPTIONAL** and is only needed if a Jupyter Notebook is to be converted into a PDF document. LaTeX is a document preparation system used extensively for the preparation of technical and scientific documents. The reader does not need to be familiar with LaTeX to work through this tutorial.\n",

    "[[ Go back to the top ]](#Table-of-contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a flexible language, and there are several ways to use it depending on your particular task.\n",
    "One thing that distinguishes Python from other programming languages is that it is *interpreted* rather than *compiled*.\n",
    "This means that it is executed line by line, which allows programming to be interactive in a way that is not directly possible with compiled languages like Fortran, C, or Java. This section will describe four primary ways you can run Python code: the *Python interpreter*, the *IPython interpreter*, via *Self-contained Scripts*, or in the *Jupyter notebook*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"pi\"></a>\n",
    "### 3.1 The Python Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic way to execute Python code is line by line within the *Python interpreter*.\n",
    "The Python interpreter can be started by installing the Python language (see the previous section) and typing ``python`` at the command prompt (look for the Terminal on Mac OS X and Unix/Linux systems, or the Command Prompt application in Windows):\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python\n",
    "Python 3.6.6 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, Jun  28 2018, 11:24:55)\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "With the interpreter running, you can begin to type and execute code snippets.\n",
    "Here we'll use the interpreter as a simple calculator, performing calculations and assigning values to variables:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    ">>> 1 + 1\n",
    "2\n",
    ">>> number = 5\n",
    ">>> number * 3\n",
    "15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter makes it very convenient to try out small snippets of Python code and to experiment with short sequences of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"ip\"></a>\n",
    "### 3.2 The IPython interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "If you spend much time with the basic Python interpreter, you'll find that it lacks many of the features of a full-fledged interactive development environment.\n",
    "An alternative interpreter called *IPython* (for Interactive Python) is bundled with the Anaconda distribution, and includes a host of convenient enhancements to the basic Python interpreter.\n",
    "It can be started by typing ``ipython`` at the command prompt:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ipython\n",
    "Python 3.6.6 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, Jun  28 2018, 11:24:55) \n",
    "Type \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    "IPython 6.5.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [1]: \n",
    "```\n",
    "The main aesthetic difference between the Python interpreter and the enhanced IPython interpreter lies in the command prompt: Python uses ``>>>`` by default, while IPython uses numbered commands (e.g. ``In [1]:``).\n",
    "Regardless, we can execute code line by line just as we did before:\n",
    "ipython\n",
    "In [1]: 1 + 1\n",
    "Out[1]: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: number2 = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "In [3]: number2 * 3\n",
    "Out[3]: 15\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that just as the input is numbered, the output of each command is numbered as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"ps\"></a>\n",
    "### 3.3 Self-contained Python scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Running Python snippets line by line is useful in some cases, but for more complicated programs it is more convenient to save code to file, and execute it all at once.\n",
    "By convention, Python scripts are saved in files with a *.py* extension.\n",
    "For example, let's create a script called *test.py* which contains the following:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# file: test.py\n",
    "print(\"Running test.py\")\n",
    "number3 = 5\n",
    "print(\"Result is\", 3 * number3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "To run this file, we make sure it is in the current directory and type ``python`` *``filename``* at the command prompt:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python test.py\n",
    "Running test.py\n",
    "Result is 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "For more complicated programs, creating self-contained scripts like this one is a must.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"jn\"></a>\n",
    "### 3.4 The Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook is a browser-based graphical interface to the IPython shell, and builds on it a rich set of dynamic display capabilities.\n",
    "As well as executing Python/IPython statements, the notebook allows the user to include formatted text, static and dynamic visualizations, mathematical equations, JavaScript widgets, and much more.\n",
    "Furthermore, these documents can be saved in a way that lets other people open them and execute the code on their own systems. Further information can be seen from the [Jupyter Project](https://jupyter.org/) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the IPython notebook is viewed and edited through your web browser window, it must connect to a running Python process in order to execute code.\n",
    "This process (known as a \"kernel\") can be started by running the following command in the system shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ jupyter notebook\n",

    "• **Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple in Python is an immutable sequence of elements, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data. Immutable means once a tuple is created, its elements and size cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are used to store related pieces of information together. They provide a convenient way to group multiple data elements and can be passed around as a single entity. Tuples are often used when the data should not be changed, such as configuration settings, coordinates, or database records.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Importance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Immutability: Guarantees data integrity and prevents accidental modification of critical information.\n",
    "  - Efficiency: Tuples are more memory efficient than lists, making them suitable for storing fixed-size, heterogeneous data.\n",
    "  - Use in Functions: Tuples are useful for returning multiple values from a function.\n",
    "  - Data Integrity: Ensures that the data remains unchanged once defined, which is crucial in many applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Data Integrity: Storing data that should not be changed, such as days of the week, configuration settings, or constants.\n",
    "  - Return Values: Returning multiple values from functions efficiently.\n",
    "  - Dictionary Keys: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries when they need to be stored as keys in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Strengths:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Immutable: Data integrity and security.\n",
    "  - Performance: Faster than lists for accessing elements.\n",
    "  - Sequence Operations: Supports all sequence operations like indexing, slicing, and iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Immutability: Once created, elements cannot be changed, necessitating the creation of a new tuple for any modification.\n",
    "  - Limited Operations: Fewer methods compared to lists.\n",
    "  - Less Flexible: Not suitable for data that needs frequent modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Suitable to Use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are suitable when:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - You want to ensure the data remains constant throughout the program.\n",
    "  - Efficiency in terms of memory and access speed is critical.\n",
    "  - Data grouping where the position of each element has significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Input and Output:**\n",

    "\n",
    "• **Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of filter is to selectively return elements from an iterable based on a condition, reducing the need for manual iteration and conditional checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Importance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Selective Filtering: Allows efficient extraction of elements that satisfy a specific condition.\n",
    "  - Readable Code: Improves code readability by focusing on the filtering condition rather than the iteration process.\n",
    "  - Functional Programming: Supports functional programming paradigms by enabling operations on data without explicit loops.\n",

    "• **Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Data Filtering: Selecting elements from a list that meet certain criteria.\n",

    "Pandas is an open source Python library for data analysis. It gives Python the ability to work with spreadsheet-like data for fast data loading, manipulating, aligning, merging, etc. To give Python these enhanced features, Pandas introduces two new data types to Python: **Series** and **DataFrame**. The **DataFrame** will represent your entire spreadsheet or rectangular data, whereas the **Series** is a single column of the **DataFrame**. A Pandas **DataFrame** can also be thought of as a dictionary or collection of **Series**.\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is often used in tandem with numerical computing tools like `NumPy` and `SciPy`, analytical libraries like `statsmodels` and `scikit-learn`, and data visualization libraries like `matplotlib`. pandas adopts significant parts of NumPy’s idiomatic style of array-based computing, especially array-based functions and a preference for data processing without for loops.\n",

    "\n",
    "In pandas, a DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It can be thought of as a table in a relational database or an Excel spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of a DataFrame in pandas is to store and manipulate data efficiently, providing powerful data analysis capabilities similar to databases or spreadsheets but with additional functionality for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Importance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Data Organization: Helps organize and manipulate structured data effectively.\n",
    "  - Integration with Series: Allows operations on entire columns (Series) efficiently.\n",
    "  - Data Analysis: Supports various data analysis tasks including filtering, aggregation, and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, converting data types, etc.\n",
    "  - Data Transformation: Applying functions and operations to columns and rows.\n",
    "  - Data Analysis and Visualization: Summarizing, grouping, and visualizing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Strengths:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Flexibility: Allows operations on rows and columns with labeled indexing.\n",
    "  - Efficiency: Optimized for performance with vectorized operations.\n",
    "  - Integration: Seamless integration with other libraries for data analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Memory Usage: Consumes more memory compared to raw arrays for large datasets due to additional metadata.\n",
    "  - Performance: Complex operations on large DataFrames can be slower compared to specialized databases for large-scale data.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Suitable to Use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrames in pandas are suitable when:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Structured data needs to be analyzed, manipulated, and visualized.\n",
    "  - Operations on columns and rows are required for data preprocessing and analysis.\n",
    "  - Integration with other data analysis and visualization tools is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Input and Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: DataFrame object containing structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: Results of operations applied to the DataFrame (filtered data, aggregated results, visualizations).\n",
    "\n",
